      <p className='pras'>After 3 long years, we are back with the grandeur events of all time, i.e. Prastuti
      '23, on the 3rd and 4th of March. We know that you were waiting for it and you
      know that it's going to be worth the wait!! This time, as KIET is observing its
      25th year anniversary, Prastuti’23 is being organized with an even bigger and
      better line-up of inter-institutional cultural competitions. These include a wide
      mélange of activities, varying from Group Singing, Group Dancing, Band War,
      Skit, Nukkad Natak, Flash Mob, Fashion Show and other cultural programs to add
      to the endless amount of entertainment. The fusion of our cultural simplicity
      and musical melodies that we will have in this golden celebration will definitely
      be an exceptional experience for everyone. The diverse amalgamation of talent,
      education, culture, and tradition will surely make Prastuti’23 relishing, ravishing,
      and worth being a part of.</p>
